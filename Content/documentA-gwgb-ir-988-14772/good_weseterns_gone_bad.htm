                <h2>Introduction to Western Blotting</h2>
                <p>Western blotting is used to positively identify a protein from a complex
            mixture. It was ﬁrst intro- duced by Towbin, et al. in 1979, as a simple
            method of electrophoretic blotting of proteins to nitrocellulose sheets.
            <span>1</span>Since then, Western blotting methods for immobilizing proteins
              onto a membrane have become a common laboratory technique. Although many
              alterations to the ori- ginal protocol have also been made, the general
              premise still exists. Macromolecules are sepa- rated using gel electrophoresis
              and transferred to a membrane, typically nitrocellulose or poly- vinylidene
              ﬂuoride (PVDF). The membrane is blocked to prevent non-speciﬁc binding
              of antibod- ies and probed with some form of detection antibody or conjugate.</p>
                <p>Near-infrared ﬂuorescence detection on the Odyssey Classic, Odyssey CLx,
              Odyssey Fc, or Odyssey Sa Imaging Systems provides a quantitative two-color
              detection method for Western Blots. This document will discuss some factors
              that may alter the performance of a near- infrared (NIR) Western blot,
              resulting in “good Westerns, gone bad.”</p>

                <h2>Important Factors That Aﬀect Western Blot Results</h2>

                    <li>
                        <p>Membrane</p>
                        <p>A low-background membrane is essential for NIR Western blot success. Background
                can result from membrane autoﬂuorescence or non-speciﬁc binding of antibodies.
                Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) and nitrocellulose membranes are typically
                used for Western blotting applications. There are many brands and vendors
                for both types of membranes.</p>
                        <p>Before using your blotting membrane for the full Odyssey Western blot
                protocol, cut a small sam- ple of membrane for testing. Image this sample
                (both wet and dry) to evaluate membrane auto- ﬂuorescence. If possible,
                include a sample of membrane that is known to work well with the Odyssey
                system, so you can compare background levels.</p>
                        <p>LI-COR has evaluated many diﬀerent transfer membranes for Western blotting;
                examples of mem- brane performance are shown in Figure 1. PVDF membranes
                typically display higher membrane autoﬂuorescence than nitrocellulose,
                and more variability in background levels. In general, nitro- cellulose
                membranes oﬀer the lowest membrane autoﬂuorescence. However, PVDF has many</p>
                        <p>advantages (including higher binding capacity, higher target retention,
                and better tensile strength) that make it an appropriate choice for many
                experiments.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Not all sources of PVDF and nitrocellulose have been evaluated by
                  LI-COR, and lot-to-lot variation can occur. It is important to evaluate
                  the membrane before use. Samples of membrane can be quickly evaluated by
                  imaging them both wet and dry with any Odyssey® System<span>.</span></p>

                        <p>Blocking Reagent</p>
                        <p>Many diﬀerent sources and types of blocking reagents are used for Western
                blot applications. Antibody performance can sometimes be compromised by
                the blocking reagent chosen. Blocking buﬀer choice may aﬀect antibody speciﬁcity
                and non-speciﬁc binding, and can dramatically in- crease the number of
                background bands (Figure 2).<span>2 </span>Excessive blocking
                (for example, with high concentrations of nonfat dry milk) may cause loss
                of blotted proteins or mask the desired anti- body-antigen interactions.
                <span>3</span></p>
                        <p>Detection reagents may cross-react with certain blocking buﬀers. Milk-based
                blockers may con- tain IgG that can cross-react with anti-goat antibodies.
                This can signiﬁcantly increase background and reduce sensitivity. Milk-based
                blockers may also contain endogenous biotin or phospho- epitopes that can
                cause higher background.</p>
                        <p><span><img alt="image" height="298" src="../Resources/Images/documentA-gwgb-ir-988-14772/Image_004.png" width="505" /></span>
                        </p>
                        <p>If an antibody fails with one blocking condition, trying another blocker
                may solve the problem. No single blocking reagent will be suitable for
                ALL antigen-antibody pairs. Refer to the <u>Odyssey®</u> <u>Western Blot Blocker Optimization Protocol</u><a href="http://www.licor.com/optimize)" target="_blank">(</a><a href="http://www.licor.com/optimize)" target="_blank">www.licor.com/optimize</a>)
                  to help design an experi- ment to optimize your blocking conditions. Figure
                  2 shows the behavior of a PKC<span>α </span>antibody in 5%
                  BSA, 5% Milk, and Odyssey Blocking Buﬀer on nitrocellulose membrane. For
                  this primary antibody, choice of blocking buﬀer had a dramatic eﬀect on
                  non-speciﬁc banding, particularly when 5% BSA was used.</p>

                  buﬀers. All blots were processed identically, with the exception of blocking
                  reagent. Images were generated with an Odyssey Classic Infrared Imager
                  (scan intensity=5, sensitivity=5).</p>

                        <p>TBS- vs. PBS-Based Blocking Buﬀers</p>
                        <p>Many blocking reagents are available in Phosphate Buﬀer or Tris Buﬀer
                (PBS/TBS) systems. In general, TBS blocking reagents are used for detection
                of phospho-proteins, because the phos- phate present in PBS blocking reagents
                may competitively bind with antibodies to phospho- proteins. Some phospho-proteins
                can be detected with PBS-based blocking reagents, depending on the antibody
                speciﬁcity and aﬃnity; however, it is important to optimize the blocking
                reagent for the speciﬁc antibody that is being used for optimal Western
                blot performance.</p>
                        <p>The same buﬀer system should be used throughout the Western blot process;
                for example, if you are using a TBS-based buﬀer system, choose Odyssey
                Blocking Buﬀer (TBS). If you are using a PBS-based buﬀer system, use Odyssey
                Blocking Buﬀer (PBS).</p>
                        <p>The experiments below show the importance of optimizing for the proper
                blocking reagent. Figure 3 shows Jurkat cell lysate stimulated with Calyculin
                (+) and a non-stimulated control (-). Phospho-Akt (green bands) was clearly
                detected with TBS-based Odyssey® Blocking Buﬀer, but could not be detected
                with the PBS-based Odyssey Blocking Buﬀer. This suggests that binding of</p>
                        <p>the pAkt primary antibody may be aﬀected by the phosphates in the PBS
                blocking reagent. Detec- tion of total Akt (red bands) was also less robust
                with the PBS buﬀer system.</p>
                        <p><span><img alt="image" height="211" src="../Resources/Images/documentA-gwgb-ir-988-14772/Image_005.jpg" width="386" /></span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Figure 3<span>. </span>Phospho-Akt detection is aﬀected by
                  TBS and PBS blocking buﬀers systems<span>. Jurkat cells were treated with Calyculin A (+) or left untreated (-), and lysates were loaded at 10 µg, 5 µg, and 2.5 µg/well. Odyssey Blocking Buﬀer (TBS) and Odyssey Blocking Buﬀer (PBS) were used for blocking and antibody dilution, as indicated; appropriate TBS and PBS buﬀers were used for washes. Blot was probed with anti-phospho-Akt mAb (rabbit; Santa Cruz P/N sc-135650) and anti- Akt mAb (mouse; CST P/N 2967). IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (LI-COR P/N 926-32221) and IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG (LI-COR P/N 926-68070) were used for detection. Blot was im- aged with an Odyssey CLx Imager (auto-scan settings, 700 and 800 nm channels). Akt bands are shown in red (700 nm), and phospho-Akt bands are shown in green (800 nm). White arrows indi- cate position of Akt band.</span></p>
                        <p>Figure 4 shows detection of phospho-EGFR in A431 cell lysate stimulated
                  with EGF (+) and in a nonstimulated (-) control. Both the PBS and TBS Odyssey
                  Blocking Buﬀer systems enabled detec- tion of phospho-EGFR. Because no
                  single blocking reagent works well with all antigen-antibody pairs, it
                  is important to test various buﬀer systems to ensure optimal detection
                  of the protein target.</p>

                        <p>Addition of detergents to diluted antibodies can signiﬁcantly reduce background

                antibodies, membrane type, and blocker used. Keep in mind that some primaries
                do not bind as tightly as others and may be washed away by too much detergent.
                Never expose the membrane to detergent until blocking is complete, as this
                may cause high membrane background.</p>

                <p>An antibody produced to detect a speciﬁc antigen is called the primary
            antibody, and it binds di- rectly to the molecule of interest. Primary
            antibodies can be produced in a wide variety of species, such as mouse,
            rabbit, goat, chicken, rat, guinea pig, human, and many others. Primary
            antibod- ies from diﬀerent vendors and sources for the same antigen may
            perform very diﬀerently. It may be necessary to test more than one primary

                                <p>Fluorescent Western blot methods and the Odyssey® Imager can detect two
                        protein targets simul- taneously. Two-color detection requires careful
                        selection of primary and secondary antibodies. The two primary antibodies
                        must be derived from diﬀerent host species so they can be discriminated
                        by secondary antibodies of diﬀerent speciﬁcities (for example, primaries
                        from rabbit and mouse will be discriminated by anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse
                        IgG secondary antibodies). One secondary antibody must be labeled with
                        IRDye® 680LT or IRDye 680RD, and the other with IRDye 800CW. IRDye Subclass-Speciﬁc

                                <p>The amount of secondary antibody used for NIR Western blot detection can
                      vary widely. When using LI-COR IRDye® 800CW and IRDye 680RD conjugated
                      secondary antibodies, the recom- mended dilution range is 1:5,000 to 1:25,000.
                      When using LI-COR IRDye 680LT secondary antibodies, the recommended dilution
                      range is 1:20,000 to 1:50,000. The dilution should be optimized for the
                      primary antibody being used and the preferred appearance of the Western
                      blot. Image Studio<span>™ </span>or Odyssey® imaging software
                      can be used to optimize the appearance of the image, for a variety of secondary
                      antibody dilutions (Figure 8). Higher dilutions (1:20,000 – 1:100,000)
                      provide lower membrane background and fewer background bands than 1:1,000
                      or 1:5,000 dilutions (Figure 8).</p>
                                <p>If too much secondary antibody is used, bands may be very strong and may
                      show saturation of signal (white pixels in Fig. 8A). Re-imaging the blot
                      at a lower scan intensity setting can often re- lieve saturation (Fig.
                      8B). Image display settings can be adjusted to optimize the brightness
                      and contrast, and make background bands less visible. In Figure 8B, image
                      display adjustments were used to make all four blots appear similar to
                      the eye. However, image display adjustments aﬀect visual presentation only
                      and do not alter the raw data in any way.</p>

                                        <p>Blots were imaged with the Odyssey Classic system with the default scan

                          of strong bands (left; white pixels in the bands). Higher dilutions do
                          not show saturation. Increased background banding is observed with 1:1,000
                          and 1:5,000 dilutions. All images were displayed with “Auto” image display

                <p>Many factors can cause contamination and increase the background levels
        of a near-infrared Western blot. Contamination can appear as a global increase

                saturation. <span>A) A two-color Western blot was imaged with the Odyssey® CLx system, using the AutoScan feature. No saturated signals were ob- served. B) The same blot was imaged repeatedly with manual Scan Intensity settings, beginning with Intensity=4. Pixel saturation is shown in white. Four separate scans were required to generate the desired image. In these lysates, tubulin (green bands) was detected with rabbit anti-Tubulin and IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (LI-COR P/N 926-32211); actin (red bands) was detected with mouse anti-actin and IRDye 680LT Goat anti-Mouse IgG (LI-COR P/N 926-68051).</span></p>
                <p>It is important to note that saturated pixels (which appear white in these
                pseudo-color im- ages) cannot be accurately quantified. Signal saturation
                can also result in “crosstalk” (de- tection of signal in the alternate
                fluorescence channel). This is easily eliminated by scanning at a lower

                <h2>Data Analysis with Odyssey® Applications Software: Background Subtraction</h2>
                <p>Odyssey Classic or Odyssey Sa (ver. 3.x application software)</p>
                <p>For accurate Western blot quantiﬁcation, the <b>Background </b>setting
            must be applied appropriately. This tool measures the intensity of the
            pixels selected as the background region. It is important to choose the
            most suitable Background calculation for your blot. There are several methods
            for background subtraction, and each method is unique to a speciﬁc need.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>No Background <span>selection uses zero for the background calculations. This is the best choice for assays with their own background calculation methods, such as concentration standards used with In-Cell Western™ Assays. The No Background method is rarely used for Western blot experiments.</span></p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Average Background <span>takes the average value of pixels on all four sides of the feature. A subset of sides (</span>All,
                  Top/Bottom<span>, or </span>Right/Left<span>) can be selected to further optimize quan- tiﬁcation. This customized background subtraction approach is used to address issues such as smears in lanes, or bands that are very close together. Choose the number of pixels to include in the calculation by changing the </span>Border
                  Width<span>.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Median <span>function sets the background level to the median value of the pixels outside the feature.</span></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>User-Deﬁned <span>background selection averages the intensity of pixels enclosed by a selected feature. To implement this method: display both image channels, draw a feature over an area of typical background (be sure not to include any saturated pixels), select the feature, choose the </span>Background
                  <span>icon from the toolbar, and change the background method to</span>User
                    Deﬁned<span>. Click </span>Save<span>, and then </span>OK
                    <span>. Notice that the feature is now designated as a Background feature. Multiple
                      features can be selected for</span>User Deﬁned Background<span>. This method is not preferred over Average or Median, due to possible inconsistencies in noise across the image.</span></p>
