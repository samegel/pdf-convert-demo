        <h2>Introduction to Western Blotting</h2>
        <p>Western blotting is used to positively identify a protein from a complex
            mixture. It was ﬁrst intro- duced by Towbin, et al. in 1979, as a simple
            method of electrophoretic blotting of proteins to nitrocellulose sheets.
            <span>1</span>Since then, Western blotting methods for immobilizing proteins
              onto a membrane have become a common laboratory technique. Although many
              alterations to the ori- ginal protocol have also been made, the general
              premise still exists. Macromolecules are sepa- rated using gel electrophoresis
              and transferred to a membrane, typically nitrocellulose or poly- vinylidene
              ﬂuoride (PVDF). The membrane is blocked to prevent non-speciﬁc binding
              of antibod- ies and probed with some form of detection antibody or conjugate.</p>
        <p>Near-infrared ﬂuorescence detection on the Odyssey Classic, Odyssey CLx,
              Odyssey Fc, or Odyssey Sa Imaging Systems provides a quantitative two-color
              detection method for Western Blots. This document will discuss some factors
              that may alter the performance of a near- infrared (NIR) Western blot,
              resulting in “good Westerns, gone bad.”</p>
